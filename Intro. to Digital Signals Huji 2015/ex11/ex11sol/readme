filter: creating normalized vector by (fs/2), getting the inputs in makefilter 
I use fir1 given in the web using Hamming window in length 200,the most proper for this situation.
I use the spectrogram given in the Ex to get spectrogram images
In order to get best view over the main frequancies at each time point,
we changed the window size and shape(rect , hamming).
I have add figur in getMusic after getting Y and get a figure and I di it also before for songs loading in the exCheck.
Finding the pitch for dScale:
each time we stripped we took from the spectogram the maximum value
- the y value is the current frequancy. 
We looked at the point when each frequancy ended/startred  and the x value of that point gives us the relevant time.
