About the Project:
This is a project that contains some calsses for latex language that used 
to get good format for texts & equations.The classes are:

Classes:
1)MathTerm: this class is the super class that the whole essential fields 
related to the different printing styles and relevant Parameter for 
the math expression.

2)SimpleMathTerm: this class is extends MathTerm, it get mathTerm and check
if numeric, and can return it with the decimal precision required and print 
the MathTerm either numeric or string.

3)BinaryMathTerm:this class extends MathTerm class,it get two MathTerms included in.

4)SimpleBinaryOpMathTerm:this class extends BinaryMathTerm & include simple math expression
 either one variable or one simple expression contains two MathTerms and mathematical operation as required.
 
5)SumMathTerm:this class is extends MathTerm and represent series (segma) with super limit and sub limit 
as MathTerms and and the intern expression also as MathTerm .

6)BracketsMathTerm: this class extends MathTerm,it represent a MathTerm between brackets.

7)FractionMathTerm: this class extends BinaryMathTerm, it represent a fraction between two mathTerms.

*************************************************************************************************************
Design: I used an inheritance OOP design and protected field. One super class for all and One SUB-super class for 
some classes , I have use the keyword super to take advantage of the fields in the the super classes.
I also use overriding for the toLatex method to use it in correct form according to required printing style in the 
exercise on the different classes.
**************************************************************************************************************
Implementation: the one interesting implementation is the Field "exponentStr" in the MathTerm Class that catch the
suitable string format for the different classes, also I get help from web forums to implement the "isNumeric" method 
in SimpleMathTerm Class and setPrecisionDigits in the same class and then I get short toLatex method.
********************************************************************************************************************  
Answer to the question: 
I will build a class called IntegramMathTerm that extends MathTerm, the constructor get a MathTerm mathTermand 
a char integralVariable that symbolizes the variable we want to do integral about-("d"+"sign"+).
the toLatex method is implemented to represent an integral format that I guess to be
("//integral"+mathTerm+" d"+sign+)
note that if we want also to get triple integral or  double integral, we will add to the constructor an additional
variable that get the required integral (normal,double,triple) and to check in the latex method what is the value of
this variable the to represent it and change the char variable (that get the constructor) to String one that include
the sequence of the integral we want (dxdydz-->the sequence xyz).then the laTex will changed as required.
