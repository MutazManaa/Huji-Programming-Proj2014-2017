=============================================================================================
**About the submitted files :
-Node class : the class that i have implemented in order to use it in implementing the AvlTree class
, its helps me to use the right and left and the parent and the vlaues of each subTree , includes 
the methods :
* Node: the Node constructor.

* getKey: return the key of the node.

* setKey: sets the node’s key.

* getParent: return the parent of the node.

* setParent: sets the node’s parent.

* getRightNode: return the right of the node.

* setRightNode: sets the node’s right.

* getLeftNode: return the left of the node.

* setLeftNode: sets the node’s left.

-AvlTree class : the main class that implements the data structure - Avl tree
, in cludes the methods:
******* the methods that we must do :

* AvlTree : A default constructor.

* AvlTree(int[] data) : A data constructor a constructor that builds the tree by adding the
elements in the input array one-by-one. If the same value appears twice
(or more) in the list, it is ignored.

*AvlTree(AvlTree tree): a copy constructor that get tree and copy it to another one by add method .

* add(int newValue) : Add a new node with key newValue into the tree , its take help from the method
balancedAdd and each time its do add to a node its check if the balance changed.
* contains(int searchVal) : Does tree contain a given input value.
* delete(int toDelete) : Remove a node from the tree, if it exists , take help from the method 
balancedDelete
, and each time its delete a node its do balance for the tree.
* size() : return number of nodes in the tree.. I haven't us size++ in add and remove but I have an
recursiveSize function that can count nodes because may you give me a tree without to construct it
then it does'nt work by add to know the size.
-------
**** the methods that i implement in order to use it in implementing the main methods :
* balancedAdd : adds the value to the avl tree by the rules of avl , helps the add method to add.
* getNode : to get the root of the tree.
* search(int toFind) : searches a node( that have the toFind value ) in the tree.
* balancedDelete(Node toDelete) : deletes a node from the tree , helpps the delete method.
* treeMinimum(Node node) : return the node that have the minimum value.
* successor(Node node) : searches and returns the successor(the successor of one node = the minimum
node that bigger than this node) of a node.
* recursiveSize(Node node) : visit each node in the tree once and counts it but
the first node(head) (because this i did +1 in size method).
* fixBalance(Node node, int form) : fixed the balance by checking wich form of wrong
 ( LNRs/RNLS/RNRS/LNLS ) and rotating.
* checkBalance(Node node) : Checks if a given node is balanced. If it’s not
, it calls fixBalance(Node node, int form) to balance it.
* rotateLeft(Node node) : Rotate the subtree to the left.
* rotateRight(Node node) : Rotate the subtree to the right.
* height(int height, Node head) : the height of the sub-tree of the node.
*the static method findMinNodes(int h): that get height and calculates the minimum number of nodes
 in an AVL tree of heigh h,
*the iterator: i have implement the iterator in nested class but their many problems facing me to 
pass the tests although the nested class and the method is correct .. may be my copy constructor
have problem i will try to fix them until assigment.
I have one test fail in contains method and I assume that their is a problem with rotating funcion 
tha their is something missing.

----------

****** answers of the questions:
answer the questions :
7 3 9 2 5 8 11 1 4 6 10 12
in the tree at the example we must insert the elements at the same level one after one so i build 
a tree with 12 elements with rotation and write the element one after one where theybe at the same 
level.
  
Notice: I have looking for the Errors many time of the null and I sure that is the same mistake and 
if I had get the mistake the three Errors will solved.

in relative to the failer test Of size I don't know why it's fail although I read and analayze the 
code many times.
yet,, and the Hour is 23:20 in the late submission on 25/5/2014 I try to find the errors and assigm 
the exercise... I hope I success..........................the problem that tree in copy constructor 
is null or I mtsbeya3 on null!!!!!
.... Why???
