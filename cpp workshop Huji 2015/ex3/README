the values time in secends
==============
answer for g:
==============
i)
we can see that in the big.txt the two operation is faster in PARALLER WAY, 
that's mean that creating threads help to improve the two proceesses. 
But, in the small.txt we see that the SEQUANTQAL way, because the copiler will
spend more time in creatin the threads, when the two proceesess in SEQ. way
will be run immediately.                                 

ii)yes, as we know that Add and Sub operation take O(a * b) complexity wherease 
a and b is the dimissional of the matrices, but multibly takes O(a * b * c)
for two matrices a,b * b,c. Inadittion the multibly of two numbers is more heavy
than sub ar add two numbers.(O(n) and O(n^2).
