===============
Design for ex2:
================
I implement three parsers for the Parameters file,queries file and songs file.
I have used inheritance and polymorphisim in the type of songs that I impelement
the Song class as super class and two sub classes: LyricsSong and InstrumentalSong.
in the super class I declared the common fields of the songs as protected  and in 
the two subClasses I add the diffirent feilds as private.
we can see the casting between Song and LyricsSong or InstrumentalSong as trivial when
we save the songs in the Songs vector.
best regard
