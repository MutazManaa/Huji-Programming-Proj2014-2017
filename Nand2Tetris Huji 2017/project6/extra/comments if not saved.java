//Sympoe Table:
/*Class SympolTable represent the decimal adress of the registrs used in the sympolic assembley */


/*return true if the sympolic key is in the sympolic table*/

/*add pair of sympole and it's decimal adress*/

/*return the decimal adress given it's sympol*/


//***********
//Parser:
/**The class parse the sympolic assembley file to lines instructions without comments and empty lines*/

 /**return true if there are more commands*/

/*retur command type*/

/*get the next instruction if there are more commands*/


/**return the sympol of the instruction as string*/

 /**return the sympol of the instruction as string*/

 /**return the dest of C-instriction as string*/

 /**return the comp of the C-instruction as string*/

 /**return the jump of C-intruction as String*/

 //*******************
// Main driver:
 /**Assembler: the main class of the project get sympolic assembley file and parse it to
non-sympolic assembley instructions and then output binary text file of translated 
assembley instructions to binary  representation*/

//Initalization: creat the sympole table and the parser

//first Pass: go over the sympolic assembley file and add new sympols 

//second pass: go over the non-sympolic file and ouput to the prog.hack the binary representation
//from prog.asm
