Answers to the Questions:
=========================
answer for part 3 Q1:
when we get some level and multibly it by number bigger than 1 or less than 1
we make the level frequency range more strong or more weak , in other words we
want to bold some range of frequency and to minor an other range..that ranges
that we want to control on.

answer for part 4 Q1:
as we learn and noticed that big filter led to big gaussian and then good blending
, but if the filter is a lot big that not siutable to the image it will led to bad 
blending.

answer for part 4 Q2:
using more and more levels for blending is led to good blending and more pure blending
, and when we use small number of levels like 1 is the original message and 2 is
little blinding and when we goes on we get a softer blending that is the matter.

Notice:1) my imReadAndConvert in my exercise 1 was wrong , I hope that I fixed it.
2)the pictur of the poletiian people express my opinion about politcians and the whole politicians not only 
performed in the picture.
