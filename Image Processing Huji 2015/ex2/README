this exercis contain the files:
================================

1)DFT.m: get an signal and return its fourier transform.
2)IDFT.m: get an fourier vector and return the original signal.
3)DFT2.m: get an image and return its fourier 2D transform.
4)IDFT2.m: get an tranform fourier for image and return the original one.
5)convDerivative.m: get and image and computes gradient (magnitude) after derivate the image in x and y directions.
6)fourierDerivative.m: get an image and computes the gradient by derivate the image by Fourier transform.
7)blurInImageSpace.m: get an image and size of gausian and blur it by convilution.
8)blurInFourierSpace.m: get an image and size of gausian and blur by Forurier.

Questions:
==========
Q1: Why did you get two different magnitude images?
A: as we learned convoluation done by the vector [1 0 -1] then when we compute the derivation we lose data 
(from the analog signal)between the pixels that's mean that the derivative by this vector is not so exact.
on the other hand the derivative by fourier transform more exact because it is up-to-a-constant, then it is more
exact than the do derivation by vector.

Q2: What happens if the center of the gaussian (in the space domain) will not be at the (0,0)
of the image? Why does it happen?
A: the image will shiffted because as we learn in lecture 2 slide ine that – Blur: Replace a pixel with an average of its
neighbors and Edge: Replace a pixel with a difference of its neighbors the when we shift the gausian we shift the result of
the conoluation.


Q3:  What is the difference between the two results (Blurring in image space and blurring in
fourier space)?

A: I noticed that there is a black frame around the picture when I use the convoluation in the blur picture 
, but not at the fourier blur.
