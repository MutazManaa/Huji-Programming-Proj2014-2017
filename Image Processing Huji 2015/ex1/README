files submitted:
==================

1)imReadAndConvert.m: get image file and code for representation,
read the image and convert it to the give code representation.

2)imDisplay.m: get image file as input and code for representation,
display the image file in the given code representation format.

3)transformRGB2YIQ.m: get an RGB image and  transforms it to the YIQ 
format.

transformYIQ2RGB.m: get an YIQ image and transforms it to RGB format.

4)histogramEqualize.m: get an image and show the equalization histogram.

5)quantizeImage.m: get grayscale or RGB image to be quantized, and the 
number of intensities your output imQuant image should have, and 
the maximum number of iterations of the optimization procedure.
 show an optimal quantization of a given image (grayscale or RGB) and 
 and calculate the error. when we creat an intitial division we avoid an
empty segments becasuse the system will crash when divide by zero,thus, no
empty segments

6)testImg1.jpg: image to test
7)testImg2.jpg: image to test

note: I assume that all the inputs are correct and no need to check 
correctness of the input.

I have uused the algorithims given in the lectur and saw examples in the 
internet. In Matlab I use changem and imadjust functions to do mapping.s
