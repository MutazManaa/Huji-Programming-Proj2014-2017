images examples:
========================
#example butterfly
1)we can notice that that the big and repeated pattern are saved.
we can see for example that the black patterns and butterfly wing's shape are biggest and sharper.

2)we can notice that the small details are lost or blured like the detilas rouned the wing and the 
small patches in round in the circle in the wing.

#example1 strawberry
1)I choose this image to emphasize the big success for the algorithim in repeatedly similar patches images
we can notice that almost the whole image was superresolused good and the big images was sharp especialy the big 
contious patches.

2)despite the repeated similar patches but we can also notice that the small details blured like the 
buttom right green leaves and we can notice that the green colour become smoothed and softer.

#example2 Coin
1)I choose this image especial to be an opposite to the prevous example, Notice that the big pattern in the coin (eagle)
is saved and sharper and only the big patterns in the image saved. but the super reso;uation image not clear

2)we can noticed stringly that the text or the rounded text are blured strongly and destored totally.
see also the small detals ariund the eagle are destored strongly.

I tried to choose two opposite examples that clarify when the algorithim is good and when it's not
I hope that I am succes to choose.
