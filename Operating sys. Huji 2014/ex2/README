EX: 2

FILES:
Thread.h--a header file that contain the function of a one thread
Thread.cpp--a file implement for one thread, it contain all functions ad feilds of one 
thread.
uthreads.h--a file required to implement in the exercise.
uthreads.cpp--a file implement the library


REMARKS:
we use a linked list of cpp in our design to represent Ready and blocked lists, and use 
three lists for the the three colours of ready status in this thre colours.
I try to use the built-in function "remove" in the list library in cpp but it doesn't work
,so I implement special and easy remove function from the lists.
I use an array to know the new Id of new threads and wen I get the new Id , I put "1" in 
the id index in that array.

ANSWERS:
1)RR-cons: no special cases for tasks in common on operating systems that mau have many problems.
RR-pros: no starvation occur.
PQ-cons:starvation happen for lower priority tasks when we deal with large number of tasks
of high priorities
PQ-pros:response time amd waitting time are low then it finish tasks faster.

2)Reading a file from harddisk may take a lot of time so we can block the thread relevant 
to reading the file and wait for it until it finishes.
